---------->Sentiment analysis is nothing but a discipline that means to extract qualitative characteristics from a user's text data, such as sentiment, opinions, thoughts, and behavioural intent using natural language processing methods. It mainly refers to identifying as well as classifying sentiments that are expressed in the text data.

---------->It analysis studies the subjective information in an expression, that is, the opinions, appraisals, emotions, or attitudes towards a topic, person or entity. Expressions can be classified as positive, negative, or neutral.

---------->Basically, the most common type of sentiment analysis is polarity detection and it involves classifying statements as Positive, Negative or Neutral. It is often used by marketing departments to monitor customer satisfaction with a service, product or brand when a large volume of feedback is obtained through social media.

---------->It can be performed at a document level, sentence level, and word level. Short texts, such as content from social media are best analysed with sentiment analysis at a sentence level as they usually consist of a single or few sentences. 


                             """"""For example""""""   :  This is the review given by a client “I really like the new design of your website!”
                                                 → So, using SENTIMENT ANALYSIS we can classify it as **Positive**.
